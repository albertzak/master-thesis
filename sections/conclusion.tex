\section{Future Work}

% nice to have features
per-field specifiable tradeoff of C/A (referecne to [emerick] in problem section)
built-in models of conflict resolution / concurrent editing

TODO think about how \gls{CRDT} may integrate with eav history?

abelson: "use logic to express what is true" "use logic to check whether something is true" "use logic to find out what is true" \cite{sicp}

[alvaro] "state is induction in time" (see intro) dedalus \cite{alvaro2010dedalus} reifies time: three temoporal extenstions to datalog:
\gls{CALM} \cite{alvaro2011consistency}

1. deductive (== plain datalog, now now now semantics) p(A,B) :- q(A,B).
2. inductive rule (contraint across "next" timestep) p(A,B)@next :- q(A,B).
3. async tile (constraint across arbitrary timesteps) p(A,B)@async :- q(A,B).

dedalus: also allows us to characterize relationships between states.
key relationships: atomicity, mutual exclusion, sequentiality.
@next is powerful! can say:
- "these two facts have to occur together or not at all" = atomicity
- "these two facts can occur one or the other, but not both" = mutual exclusion
- "this thing happens, then this thing happens" = sequentiality

\paragraph{Incremental maintenance.}

\cite{green2013datalog}
timely dataflow \cite{murray2013naiad}
The Differential dataflow \cite{mcsherry2013differential}

3df [reactive datalog for datomic, goebel] \cite{gobel2019optimising}


\paragraph{Data as code.}
Do we need version control?
